## Computer Vision Face Detection with OpenCV :octocat: 


#### Applying Viola - Jones algorithm for finding Harr like features in the image, applying Cascading using OpenCV

*The process goes like this,*

- Capture the frames in the video
- Convert it to gray frame using openCVs COLOR_BGR2GRAY package
- Detect the face using detectMultiScale function of OpenCv
- Detect the eyes using detectMultiScale function 
- Capture the co-ordinates of the face and show it in the color frame in the video

### *'Viola' face detected! :+1:*
